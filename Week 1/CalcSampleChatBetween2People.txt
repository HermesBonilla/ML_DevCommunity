[8/31/20, 9:28:02 PM] H: Idk I did fine on the hws, those were easy but on the quiz even after my second attempt I got 65% :/

[9/2/20, 8:52:11 PM] Person 1: I'm actually doing that one too rn
‚Äé[9/2/20, 8:52:29 PM] Person 1: ‚Äéimage omitted
[9/2/20, 9:38:46 PM] Person 1: Can anyone show their work for q6? It's the only one I didn't understand
[9/4/20, 7:59:57 PM] H: Thanks C___
[9/5/20, 8:51:52 PM] H: When is the math review due?
[9/6/20, 12:01:12 AM] Person 1: Anyone else got a 0 on their learning activity 3?
[9/6/20, 7:32:21 AM] H: Dw lmao, thanks for your answer and thanks to c___
[9/6/20, 7:32:44 AM] H: Yup I still do so I think she may not have graded everyones yet
[9/7/20, 6:41:40 PM] Person 1: REMEMBER hw and quiz due tonight
[9/7/20, 7:26:47 PM] H: Thanks L____ for the reminder
‚Äé[9/7/20, 9:53:36 PM] H: Ye I had to fail it once to understand it
[9/7/20, 9:54:07 PM] H: So you‚Äôre given the second derivative and the first derivative
[9/7/20, 9:55:52 PM] H: And you need to take the integral of the second derivative in order to get something like -kt+96 (the given ds/dt shows you this formula when t=0)
[9/7/20, 9:57:44 PM] H: And so then take the integral of -kt+96 to get something like (-kt^2/2)+96t and that‚Äôs the formula you equal to 288
[9/7/20, 9:58:55 PM] H: ^thats step 3
For step 2 you ust solve for t when the formula is at its first derivative [-kt+96] which should give you a fraction with k as a denominator and a constant as numerator
[9/7/20, 9:59:11 PM] H: My bad, Im not really good at explaining
[9/7/20, 10:01:59 PM] H: Nah dw, I suggest ust clicking wrong answers and seeing how the answers look like, it helps to see what they expect you to do
[9/7/20, 10:03:24 PM] Person 1: this hw long af
[9/7/20, 10:15:02 PM] H: Yupp

[9/8/20, 10:59:08 AM] H: Yeah, I even knew the formulas but the last one took me too much time
[9/8/20, 12:22:52 PM] H: Can‚Äôt stay today, pls lmk if she covers something special
[9/9/20, 10:38:54 AM] H: Fr?
